            <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
            <p>Born in Conroe, Texas, Riley Vagis has always been surrounded by music. Some of her earliest memories include being in the car with her father and listening to Beethoven and Vivaldi, so music has always been a prominent part of her life. So it’s no surprise that Riley has fallen in love with the art, and is soon to graduate with Loyola University New Orleans with a degree in both Vocal Performance and Composition.</p> 

             <p>Her stay at Loyola has gifted her with the opportunity to perform in stage and community events which include - but are not limited to - <em>Dido and Aeneas</em> by Purcell as 2nd Woman, <em>Gianni Schicchi</em> by Puccini as La Ciesca, <em>Suor Angelica</em> by Puccini as The Monitor, and in any scenes programs where she has performed as Perichole from Offenbach’s <em>La Perichole</em>, Orsini in Donizetti’s <em>Lucrezia Borgia</em>, Dorabella in Mozart’s <em>Cosi fan Tutte</em>, and Mignon in <em>Mignon</em> by Thomas. And soon she will be performing as the 3rd Lady in Mozart's <em>The Magic Flute</em> (in English). Community events include Opera on Tap with the New Orleans Opera and singing in church choir on the holidays!</p>

            <p>Her performances don’t just end at Loyola, though. Miss Vagis was invited to join the Janiec Opera Company in the Summer of 2022 with the Brevard Music Center, where she was invited to perform as the Housemaid in Leigh’s <em>Man of La Mancha</em>, a chorus member in Bizet’s <em>Carmen</em> - which included covering the role of Mercedes - opened the Night with Cole Porter show with the famous song <em>Anything Goes</em>, and was cast as Maddelena in Verdi’s <em>Rigoletto</em> and Mercedes in Bizet’s <em>Carmen</em> for the Opera’s Greatest Hits scene’s program. And as for the future, Miss Vagis is slated to perform in the chorus of Puccini’s <em>Madama Butterfly</em> with the New Orleans Opera.</p>

            <p>As for her Composition life, Miss Vagis is the Theory Tutor at Loyola University New Orleans as well as the Theory department Teaching Assistant! She has composed songs ranging from choral ensembles, art songs, and full orchestra pieces, and plans to write more in the future! </p>
